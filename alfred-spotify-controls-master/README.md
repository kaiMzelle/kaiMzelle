## How to use (Search)

You can also search inline with results showing up in the results panel of Alfred. Simply type `spot search` followed by `artist` or `album` or `track` then your query. The results will start to appear in the file list within Alfred. After that, find the result you want and either press `Return` on your keyboard or click the result. Spotify will open and go directly to that result.

### Examples
```
spot search artist De La Soul
spot search album Stakes is High
spot search track Sunshine
```

## Searching with images enabled (Thanks to [Robin Enhorn](https://github.com/enhorn) for this addition)

Instead of using the default Spotify logo for search results you can use the actual images found for your search. This feature does not ship enabled with this worfklow because Spotify does **NOT** include the image in their API response.

Instead it calls out to the actual Spotify URL and scrapes the image from the page. Since this takes some time to get all the images, you have to enable this feature. Also by enabling this feature it will cut your possible results from 15 to 5 to save some time.

### How To

* Open the workflow in Alfred (open Alfred preferences, clicks on the Workflows icon and click the `Spotify` worklow)
* Double click the action labeled `spot search`
* Change `IMAGES="no"` to `IMAGES="yes"`
* Save
* Done
